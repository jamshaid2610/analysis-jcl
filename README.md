# Perfomance Analysis of Durham Junior Cricket League U-13 using Unsupervised Learning Techniques

In this project, I intend to use unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering, principal component analysis and autoencoders to analyse the performance of Durham Cricket County's Junior Cricket League specifically for the season 2023. The goal of this project is to cluster high performing players and helping the Durham Cricket county to promote this players to their senior league. This project aims to use two types of data: ball-by-ball data and separate scorecards for batting and bowling. At first the project applies two techniques to reduce the dimensions of the data, one is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the other is autoencoders, followed by applying K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to recognise patterns and cluster players according to their performances. The project will address three aspects: identifying key performance metrics, clustering players according to their performances using unsupervised learning, and highlighting the correlation among various performance metrics. The main aim of this project is to help Durham Cricket County identify top talent using advanced analytical methods and use the model for their future seasons.
